In every model in which sentence Alpha is True, sentence B is also True.

### Inference

The process of deriving new sentences from old ones

## MODEL-CHECKING

* To determine if Knowledge base entails Alpha
  *  Enumerate all possible models
  *  If in every model where knowledge base is True, Alpha is also true then Knowledge Base entails Alpha.
  *  Otherwise Knowledge Base doesnot entails Alpha.
